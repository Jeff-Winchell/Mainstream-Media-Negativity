This is not detailed enough, but it will get better over time.

Install SQL Server 2019 for Windows (The Developer's Edition is free if you use it personally, not commercially). There is a LINUX edition. I don't know LINUX so you will need to get help from others where it differs from the Windows version.

SQL Install Instructions (see SQL_Server_2019_Install.txt)

Once you have SQL Server installed and configured, you can run the DDL.sql file within SQL Server to create the empty database, optimizations and custom programs stored in the database. Change the name of the database in the top dozen or so lines if you want the database name to be different. Then run DML.sql to manually add some key data.

Then install python and the Beautifulsoup, Pyodbc and Jupyter Notebook python libraries (and whatever python libraries they require). I recommend using Miniconda to do all of this.

Then run the jupyter notebook file get_transcript.ipynb.
